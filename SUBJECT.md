### Context

The Moon is currently re-investigated by space agencies and private compagnies in the scope of a new generation of humankind exploration. The international program ARTEMIS, led by NASA plan to land a crew in the lunar south polar region in the next decade. In this context, we focus on the surface characterization by photometry, that will help to de-risk the future landing and traversability but also constraint the fundamental planetary science processes governing the space weathering.

Planetary photometry is a technique that consist in the observation of the very same region at various observation and illuminations angles. Multi-angular photometry provides an innovative method to surpass the limitations of optical resolution by employing a statistical/physical approach. This technique can extract sub-pixel surface information at the cost of acquiring additional images/data of that area under diverse viewing geometries. Overall, the primary potential for improvements in our understanding of the surface properties of the Moon does not arise from the improvements in optical performance we propose. Rather, the potential for radical improvements comes from the proposed exploration strategy that is uniquely designed to support multi-angular photometry.


### Program

This PhD will be involved in the Lunar orbiter mission project lead by Denmark that will map the surface of the Moon - Máni in old Norse – in the highest spatial resolution ever and surpass the optical capabilities of the telescope to probe surface properties down to µm scales. By employing an exploration strategy based on multi-angular photometric mapping, we aim to provide sub-pixel information on the Lunar micro-texture down to µm scales, in addition to vastly improved elevation maps. The mapping we propose will facilitate and de-risk future exploration missions, initiate and enable new scientific investigations, and showcase the potential of using a photometric mapping approach for future exploration missions further into space. Notably, the improved quantification of the Lunar reflectance function this mission provides will also support Earth observations through their use of the Moon as a calibration source and improve terrestrial climate models by enabling better quantification of Earth’s albedo. 

The PhD student will be involved in the programmatic phase of the Máni mission, in the data pipeline definition and in the realization of the photometry treatment software.


In complement of this program, the second aim of the PhD is to develop a laboratory equipment to measurement the photometry of rock samples. It will consist in the development of a spectro-photo-goniometer at GEOPS laboratory to complement the PANOPLY equipment suite already available. Prototyping such an instrument will benefit from the large experience of the team at GEOPS, including 3D printing and automatization. This new instrument will consist in two moving arms pointing on a target that would simulate the geometry from space. One arm will contain an illumination source and the second one a spectro-photometric detector. The system will be designed with a set of calibration targets to estimate the reflectance of the surface.

The PhD student will contribute to build the instrument, lead a campaign of laboratory calibration and validation including with comparison with other reference equipment. The last part of the PhD will be dedicated to the observation of planetary rock analogs measurement to prepare the lunar exploration of Máni.
